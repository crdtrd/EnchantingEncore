# EnchantingEncore
## Summary
A server side fabric mod that changes how enchanting works, adding new bookshelf setup mechanics and higher level vanilla enchantments.
## Features
- Filled chiseled bookshelves and regular bookshelves both count to the enchantment level.
- Bookshelves can be detected within a 9x9 cube centered on the enchantment table, minus the center 3x3 column.
- Bookshelves can sit behind other bookshelves and still be able to transmit enchantment power to the enchantment table, allowing for more unique library setups.
- 1 bookshelf = 1 additional enchantment level, up to level 50.
- The higher enchantment level cap means higher level enchantments are now available, including treasure enchantments and curses at the highest levels.
- If a chiseled bookshelf is filled with enchanted books that all share an enchantment, the likelihood of that enchantment being selected in the enchantment table is increased. This can be stacked with more common enchantments between books in a bookshelf and with more bookshelves.
