Bookshelf Detection
- Up to 3 air blocks between bookshelf and enchanting table.
- Detectable from below.
- Full chiseled bookshelves count toward enchantment level.

Chiseled Bookshelves
- Add to enchantment level when full.
- Enchantments in enchanted books in chiseled bookshelves increase the likelihood that enchantment will be selected as an enchantment, with enchantment power of those enchantments further increasing that likelihood.
- The weight of that enchantment is additive, so 100% chance for an enchantment is never achieved, but you can get to practically 100%.

Deciding Enchantment Levels
    Vanilla enchantment level calculations
    - b = number of nearby bookshelves
    - Base enchantment level available (base) = (randomInt(1,8) + floor(b / 2) + randomInt(0,b))
    - Top slot enchantment level = floor(max(base / 3, 1))
    - Middle slot enchantment level = floor((base × 2) / 3 + 1)
    - Bottom slot enchantment level = floor(max(base,b × 2))

    New enchantment level calculations
    - b = number of nearby bookshelves
    - Base enchantment level available (base) = (randomInt(1,4) + floor(b / 2))
    - Top slot enchantment level = floor(max(base / 3, 1))
    - Middle slot enchantment level = floor((base × 2) / 3 + 1)
    - Bottom slot enchantment level = floor(max(base,b))
    - The effect is that each bookshelf adds a maximum enchantment level, except for the first 8 bookshelves where the base equation is used, starting at a base level of 4 and adding a level every 2 bookshelves.
    - The new enchantment level cap is 50.

As For The Enchantments Themselves
